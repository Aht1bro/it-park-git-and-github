    <div class="panel">
        <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[9][10] Standing on the River Thames
            in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, it has been a major
            settlement for two millennia.[11] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by
            the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][12][13][14][15][16] Since
            the 19th century,[17][18][19] "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically
            split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[20] which largely makes up
            Greater London,[21] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.[note 2][22][23][24] The City of
            Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.
