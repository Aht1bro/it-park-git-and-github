<div class="panel">
  <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[9][10] Standing on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, it has been a major settlement for two millennia.[11] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][12][13][14][15][16] Since the 19th century,[17][18][19] "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[20] which largely makes up Greater London,[21] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.[note 2][22][23][24] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.
